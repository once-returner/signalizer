The currently supported build platforms are Windows and OS X. 
Linux support is experimental and only confirmed to work on Ubuntu 16. See Make/LinuxInstructions.txt for instructions.
For OS X, you will need Xcode 5.1.1+ as well as the audio unit SDKs installed.
If you want to use the build scripts you need to have the Xcode command line tools installed.

If you wish to compile VSTs, you will need to acquire the VST3 SDK. Similarly for other proprietary platforms.

You will also need the cpl library. It has a home page here:

The online repository is here:

For Windows, you will need Visual Studio 2013+.

Additionally, you may need to set up include directories to point to your specific SDK locations. Note that you cannot reference cpl directly, it has to be in a folder (like /sdks/ or something that you reference).
