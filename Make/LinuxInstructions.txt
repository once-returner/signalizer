There's currently no working make file, compilation is done through Code::Blocks, so you'll need that. Only GCC and x64 targets on linux is supported as of now.

To compile, navigate to this folder and run "python build_linux.py". A .zip output should be printed, the content of which
is the final working plugin. This should be moved to your .vst folder, and hopefully it will magically work from there on.
